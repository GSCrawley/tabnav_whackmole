### Whack - A - Troll

# the App is Live at: https://expo.dev/@gcrawley/whackamole

## This is my Final Project for FEW 2.4: React Native with JavaScript. It's the MVP of a game that I plan to continue working on. This version has one working round of the game and also keeps score, as well as a tab navigation system to navigate from the welcome screen to the game and back. 
## There is a lot more that I'd like to do with this but I wasn't able to find the time yet. Right now it's a functional one-round game that keeps score. I plan to add the following:
    - a Reset button
    - a way to save scores and compete with your best score as well as that of others, which would also entail
    -a leaderboard. 
    - a screen where you can choose your troll character from among a number of them, which would also entail another tab navigator
    -a 3rd animation that takes place when the troll avatar is touched (whacked), showing it getting squished
